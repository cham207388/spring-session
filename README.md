# Spring session

## features that I implement in this project:

* login - a session is created for a user. This user has access to most operations of the API
* logout- upon logout, the user's access to the API is revoked
* Aspect- Exception handling is written in a controller advice class for brevity
* specific exception handling for different type of exception. Use appropriate status code
* I have several spring boot and microservice courses on my udemy account. I will continue to add more features as I continue learning new techniques.
